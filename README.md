=======================
Unofficial Android app for Watchwords / Hesla

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.reiss.android.losungen"><img src="https://github.com/JoachimR/LosungenApi16/blob/master/art/github_promo.png"></a>

# Languages

Currently supported languages (with legal permission):
 - <a href="http://hesla.dulos.cz/">Czech</a>

For other languages to be added the legal permission needs to be given first.

So far the content is provided <a href="https://github.com/JoachimR/LosungenApi16/tree/master/app/src/main/res/raw">by the app itself</a>.

Therefore the data will not be downloaded and so the app needs to be updated on a regular basis.

If you want to provide a server from which the users could download the data dynamically, feel free to contact me.
